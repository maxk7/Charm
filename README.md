# Charm

Local, customized [Hydra Visualizer](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/?sketch_id=celeste_2) for reactive art and live music visualization

### Security Warnings

This project is currently under active development. During this phase, the client application **executes JavaScript code received from the local backend server without strict validation.** This practice, while expedient for development, introduces significant security risks. Users are strongly advised to run Charm only if they are fully aware of and accept the inherent security vulnerabilities associated with this temporary design. Proceed with caution and ensure appropriate safeguards are in place.
